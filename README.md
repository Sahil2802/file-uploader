### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Supabase Account** (for backend services)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sahil2802/file-uploader.git
   cd file-upload-assignment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file and add your Supabase credentials:

   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
   ```

4. **Set up Supabase Database:**

   In your Supabase project, run the following SQL to create the necessary tables:

   ```sql
   -- Create events table
   CREATE TABLE events (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     date DATE NOT NULL
   );

   -- Create registrations table
   CREATE TABLE registrations (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL,
     UNIQUE(user_id, event_id)
   );

   -- Enable Row Level Security
   ALTER TABLE events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ALTER TABLE registrations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create policies for events table
   CREATE POLICY "Events are viewable by everyone" ON events
     FOR SELECT USING (true);

   CREATE POLICY "Events can be inserted by authenticated users" ON events
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

   CREATE POLICY "Events can be updated by authenticated users" ON events
     FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

   CREATE POLICY "Events can be deleted by authenticated users" ON events
     FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

   -- Create policies for registrations table
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own registrations" ON registrations
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own registrations" ON registrations
     FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own registrations" ON registrations
     FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

   -- Insert sample events
   INSERT INTO events (name, date) VALUES
   ('Tech Conference 2025', '2025-03-15'),
   ('Web Development Workshop', '2025-04-20'),
   ('AI & Machine Learning Summit', '2025-05-10'),
   ('Mobile App Development Bootcamp', '2025-06-05'),
   ('DevOps Best Practices Seminar', '2025-07-12');
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the application.
